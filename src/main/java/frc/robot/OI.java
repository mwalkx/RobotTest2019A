  //// CREATING BUTTONS
  // One type of button is a joystick button which is any button on a
  //// joystick.
  // You create one by telling it which joystick it's on and which button
  // number it is.
  // Joystick stick = new Joystick(port);
  // Button button = new JoystickButton(stick, buttonNumber);

  // There are a few additional built in buttons you can use. Additionally,
  // by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
  // commands the same as any other Button.

  //// TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
  // Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of
  // three ways:

  // Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
  // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
  // button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());

  // Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
  // the button is released.
  // button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());

  // Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command
  // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
  // button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());

  //Joystick joystick0 = new Joystick(0);
  XboxController xb1 = new XboxController(0);

  Button buttonA = new JoystickButton(xb1, 1);
  Button buttonB = new JoystickButton(xb1, 2);
  Button leftBumper = new JoystickButton(xb1, 5);
  Button rightBumper = new JoystickButton(xb1, 6);

  // Button jbutton1 = new JoystickButton(joystick0, 1);

  public OI() {
    // constructor to set up buttons and actions
    // jbutton1.whenPressed(new DriveIt());

    buttonA.whenPressed(new OpenActuator(true));
    buttonB.whenPressed(new OpenActuator(false));
